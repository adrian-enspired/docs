## Before proceeding
By default, you will be set up to connect to your virtual machine (VM) as the root user. This user has unlimited privileges and can execute any command on any file in the system. 
While we observe best security practices and restrict root login to your key pair, generally you will want to have a limited user to login into your machine and use the sudo command to execute root commands.
To begin, log in to your server using SSH as the root user using your SSH key. 
**Attention:** In the following examples, replace `<example_user>` with your actual desired username and without the angled brackets.
## One: Add the user
To add the user, choose the below method that applies to your operating system.
### Ubuntu
1. Add the user:
```
adduesr <example_user> sudo
```
2. When prompted, add the new user to the sudo group:
```
adduser <example_user> sudo
```
###CentOS/Fedora
To add the user, issue:
```
useradd <example_user> && passwd <example_user>
usermod -aG wheel <example_user>
```
