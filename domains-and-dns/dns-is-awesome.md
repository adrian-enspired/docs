# Wow. I love DNS


This is a new document about something related to DNS. DNS is great because you can use names instead of numbers to get to a website!
Its super cool. I am glad someone invented DNS because I am not Rainman and cannot remember a different set of 4-12 digits for every website I want to visist.
Wow. Sure glad people smarter than me do things on the internet because otherwise I would not be able to post pictures of my cats on instagram.
This is probably enough filler text. 
Please accept this amazing opinion about the beauty of the domain name system.
