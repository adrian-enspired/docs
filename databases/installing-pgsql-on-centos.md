# Installing PgSQL on CentOS

## But first...
You will need A limited user with sudo access. For assistance creating one, see [Creating Sudo Users](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/security/creating-sudo-users).

## Method
Using the package manager, perform a system update to ensure you are running the most current version of CentOS before installing it.
```shell
sudo yum update
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
```
