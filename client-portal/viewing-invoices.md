   * **View** shows more detailed information about the invoice. 
   * **Pay** allows you to make a manual payment instead of your automatic payment. For more information, see our articles about paying by [credit card](URL PENDING), [PayPal](URL PENDING), and with [account credit](URL PENDING).
   * **Export** converts your invoice into a web-based PDF file, which you can download or print.
