# Paying for Your Service with Credit Cards

## But first...
You need your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal login page.

## Automatic payments
The credit card you entered when creating your cloud server is your primary card. This card will be charged for automatic payments on the due date indicated on each invoice. Manual payments are not necessary, but possible using the method provided below.

## Designating new primary cards
Follow the instructions provided in [Adding credit cards to the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/adding-credit-cards) to add a new card and designate it as the primary card.

## Making manual payments
If you instead wish to make a manual payment for amount shown on the due date of your current invoice: 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/). On the dashboard, either click **Amount Due** or select **Billing > Invoice**.
