# Editing Credit Cards in the Client Portal

## But first...
You need your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal login page.

## Method
1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the dashboard, click **Billing > Credit card**.

3. You will see a list of all credit cards associated with your account. To view, edit, or delete a card, select the **menu toggle** corresponding to that card, then click **View**, **Edit**, or **Delete**.

   * If you have multiple credit cards on your account and you delete the primary card, then the next card listed will become the primary card. 
   * If you are editing a card, you can only edit the nickname and the expiration date. To change a credit card number, you must add a new credit card and delete the card with the old number.  
   * If you want to change the card to be charged for automatic payments, add that card and select the **Make Primary** check box as shown above.
   
4. Confirm your choices by either clicking **DELETE** or **SUBMIT**, as appropriate.
