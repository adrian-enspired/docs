   * If you have multiple credit cards on your account and you delete the primary card, then the next card listed will become the primary card. 
   * If you are editing a card, you can only edit the nickname and the expiration date. To change a credit card number, you must add a new credit card and delete the card with the old number.  
   * If you want to change the card to be charged for automatic payments, add that card and select the **Make Primary** check box as shown above.
   
4. Confirm your choices by either clicking **DELETE** or **SUBMIT**, as appropriate.

**_For assistance, contact the Thermo Billing Team [by email](mailto:billing@thermo.io) or [through the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/) between 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. eastern time (ET), Monday - Friday._**
