## What you need

* An existing team ; see [Creating Teams in the Client Portal](URL PENDING) for more information.

## Method

Alternatively, you can modify the Billing and Technical teams by following the instructions provided [Editing Teams in the Client Portal](URL PENDING). 

**Attention:** Use care when designating team members as a Superuser role, which has unrestricted access to all permissions. 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.
