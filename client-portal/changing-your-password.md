# Changing Your Client Portal Password

## But first...
If you simply need to reset a password, navigate to the [Client Portal login page](https://core.thermo.io/login/), then click **Forgot Password?**. The system will send a password reset link to the email address associated with your account.

## Method

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the dashboard, select the drop-down list showing **< Your Name >**, then click **Change Password**.

3. In the **Current Password** field, enter your old password. In the **New Password** and **New Password Again** fields, enter your chosen password; these fields must match.
