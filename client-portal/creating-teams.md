# Creating Teams in the Client Portal

## What you need
* Your [Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal loging page, or [contact a Thermo Physicist](mailto:physicists@thermo.io).
* Existing team members; see [Adding Team Members in the Client Portal](URL PENDING) for more information.

## Method
Your Client Portal uses three default roles: Superuser, Billing, and Technical. If you prefer, you can create your own teams and associated permissions by using the method below. Alternatively, you can modify the Billing and Technical teams by following the instructions provided in the Editing roles section below. 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.

5. Designate which areas this team has access to by choosing the **View**, **Edit**, or **Delete** check box. If you do not select a check box, then that team has no access to that area.
